; This program multiplies two 8-bit numbers (10 and 20)
; and stores the 16-bit result (200) in memory.

ORG 2000H       ; Program starts at memory address 2000H

MVI D, 00H      ; Initialize register D to 00H (high byte of the result).
MVI E, 00H      ; Initialize register E to 00H (low byte of the result).
MVI B, 0AH      ; Load 'a' = 10 (0AH) into register B.
MVI C, 14H      ; Load 'b' = 20 (14H) into register C.

LOOP:
ADD C           ; Add the value of 'b' (in C) to the accumulator (A).
JNC NEXT        ; Jump to NEXT if there's no carry.
INR D           ; Increment D (the high byte of the result) if there's a carry.

NEXT:
DCR B           ; Decrement 'a' (in B).
JNZ LOOP        ; Jump back to LOOP if 'a' is not zero.

MOV H, D        ; Move the high byte of the result from D to H.
MOV L, E        ; Move the low byte of the result from E to L.
SHLD 2050H      ; Store the 16-bit result (in HL pair) into memory, starting at 2050H.

HLT             ; Halt the program.
